# POGS React UI

An OSS initiative to rewrite an Angular 1.x interface for
[POGs](http://pogs.uoregon.edu) using React 15.5.x in order to improve page
speed, add new visualizations to the orthologous groups pages, add user options
to save groups pages, and more. Please see the
[scholarly journal article](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0082569) to
learn more about the science behind this dashboard. We're still in the early
stages of the rebuild and are looking for contributors to help out.
